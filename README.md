# MATLAB GUI for Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Optimization
 
Perform FEA simulations by inputting force, displacement, and strain parameters. Visualize results with graphs. Import bridge coordinates from Excel for detailed analysis and optimization. 

How to setup:
1) Download, source the MATLAB file (Project1_app.mlapp)
2) Run simulations effortlessly.

Additional Points:
Supported features: such as force/displacement/strain input, visualization graphs, and optimization capabilities ...
The flexibility to import bridge coordinates from Excel Data Sheet for a more realistic and detailed analysis.
